# WeedMaps
This project includes a script meant to extract data from the website "weedmaps.com" and load that data into a SQL database. Also included is the resulting SQL databse with extracted data.

The data extracted was from all stores (dispensaries, delivery services, and doctors) in the US and Puerto Rico and included the following variables:

        1.  business
        2.  address
        3.  city
        4.  state
        5.  zip_code
        6.  timezone
        7.  license_type
        8.  type_desc
        9.  web_url
        10. count


In order to run this script you will need the following applications:

        1.  SQLite


You will also need the following python libraries:
    
        1.  requests
        2.  numpy
        3.  json
        4.  urllib
        5.  sys
        6.  sqlite3


To run the script, fork/branch the repository or download the .py file to the folder/location in which you would like the SQL file to be created. Then run the script from your IDE or through the command line (after moving to the working directory). 

Best of luck!
