# WeedMaps
This project includes a script meant to extract data from the website "weedmaps.com" and load that data into a SQL database. Also include is the resultant SQL databse with extracted data.

In order to run this script you will need the following applications:

    1. SQLite
   
You will also need the following python libraries:
    
    1. requests
    2. numpy
    3. json
    4. urllib
    5. sys
    6. sqlite3

To run the script, fork/branch the repository or download the .py file to the folder/location in which you would like the SQL file to be created. Then run the script from your IDE or through the command line (after moving to the working directory). Best of luck!
